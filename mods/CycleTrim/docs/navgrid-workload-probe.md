# NavGrid workload probe

This is a developer-only measurement path for issue #25. It is disabled unless the ONI process starts with `CYCLETRIM_NAVGRID_PROBE=1` (also accepts `true` or `yes`). Normal CycleTrim users pay no per-call probe cost because Harmony skips the patch at load time when the variable is absent.

The probe observes the real parameterless `NavGrid.UpdateGraph()` before expansion and aggregates only data that a future cheap dispatcher could know: unique dirty-cell count as stored by ONI, `updateRangeX`, `updateRangeY`, and seed bounding-box density. It does not replace `UpdateGraph`, alter `DirtyCells`, or select an optimization path.

Reports are cumulative histograms. Formatting/logging is deferred through `UIScheduler.ScheduleNextFrame`; the `UpdateGraph` prefix only scans the existing dirty list and updates fixed-size counters. `UIScheduler` uses ONI's unscaled UI clock, so a report that was requested while the simulation was running can still flush after the game is paused. Reports are requested after call 1, 64, 256, 1024, and then every 4x growth. The normal report shows only the 12 most common dirty-count/range/density buckets so ordinary developer logs stay readable.

For quantitative captures, also start ONI with `CYCLETRIM_NAVGRID_PROBE_CAPTURE=1`. At each sparse report point CycleTrim then emits an additional `[CycleTrim][NavGridProbeCapture]` line containing every non-zero histogram bucket, not just the top 12. This can make the developer log line substantially larger, so the complete mode is opt-in and should only be enabled while gathering issue #25 evidence.

Analyze the resulting ONI log with:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_cycletrim_navgrid_probe.py /path/to/Player.log --pretty > navgrid-capture.json
```

The analyzer uses the latest probe startup in the log, requires the `NavGrid.UpdateGraph() resolved` and `target reached; aggregate sampling started` markers, rejects captures where FastTrack disabled baseline sampling, and verifies that the complete bucket counts sum exactly to the reported call count. A top-12-only or otherwise truncated report therefore fails instead of silently producing misleading workload fractions.

For a controlled workload window, first analyze the log and record the latest `calls` value, run the workload long enough to cross another sparse report point, then pause and wait for the unscaled UI scheduler to emit the deferred complete report before analyzing again:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_cycletrim_navgrid_probe.py /path/to/Player.log --after-calls 256 --pretty
```

`--after-calls` must match an existing complete capture in the current probe run and only accepts a later capture whose cumulative call count is larger. The analyzer now subtracts the baseline complete histogram from the later complete histogram: top-level `calls`, `empty`, `buckets`, and `candidateGate` describe only the fresh workload window, while `baselineCalls` and `cumulativeCalls` preserve the cumulative endpoints. Bucket counters must remain monotonic and their deltas must sum exactly to the fresh call count, so malformed or inconsistent windows fail closed instead of silently reusing earlier workload distribution.

The runtime NavGrid probe is still process-static and currently has no save/session generation marker. Therefore an `--after-calls` window must stay within the same loaded game/session; do not place the baseline before a save/load transition. The analyzer can reject a process restart because the latest probe startup marker changes, but it cannot prove that two cumulative captures on either side of an in-process save/load belong to the same game. Fixing that lifecycle boundary would change the runtime probe and scheduler/callback ownership, so it remains separate from this offline analyzer correction.

The JSON also reports `candidateGate` bounds for the current synthetic `NavGridAdaptiveGateBenchmark` rule (`dirty >= 20`, short range `>= 2`, long range `>= 4`). The runtime histogram deliberately keeps coarse buckets such as `dirty=16-23`, so a capture cannot always say exactly how many calls would satisfy that candidate rule. `eligibleCallsLowerBound` counts only buckets that are guaranteed to satisfy it, `eligibleCallsUpperBound` includes threshold-crossing buckets that might satisfy it, and `ambiguousCalls` is the difference. In `--after-calls` mode these bounds are computed from the fresh histogram delta, not from calls that happened before the baseline. These are workload-coverage bounds, not a production routing decision or performance claim. The contract check keeps the analyzer thresholds synchronized with the benchmark constants.

A valid capture must contain both the startup message saying `NavGrid.UpdateGraph() resolved` and a later `target reached; aggregate sampling started` message with a summary whose `calls` value is non-zero. If FastTrack's active `PeterHan.FastTrack.PathPatches.NavGrid_UpdateGraph_Patch` is detected, CycleTrim reports that sampling is disabled instead of mixing FastTrack-replaced traffic into the baseline.

For useful #25 evidence, capture several workload classes separately: an idle colony, a construction/deconstruction burst, doors or automation changing path topology, and critter-heavy activity. Record the ONI build and enabled mod set with each capture. Use complete capture mode plus an `--after-calls` baseline for any controlled workload whose bucket fractions will be fed back into `NavGridAdaptiveGateBenchmark`; the normal top-12 summary is only for quick human inspection. The probe is for workload distribution and reachability only; its own instrumentation overhead must not be reported as an FPS or CPU speedup.
